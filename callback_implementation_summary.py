Summary of Multi-Horizon Callback Implementation
===============================================

PROFESSIONAL ANALYSIS:

The callbacks have been implemented to meet the exact requirements:

1. ✅ BOTH EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau counters are printed every epoch
2. ✅ Both callbacks monitor ALL predicted horizons' validation MAE metrics
3. ✅ If ANY horizon shows improvement (reduced MAE), BOTH counters reset to zero
4. ✅ If NO horizon shows improvement, BOTH counters increment

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

1. ReduceLROnPlateauWithCounter:
   - Monitors: ['val_output_horizon_1_mae_magnitude', 'val_output_horizon_2_mae_magnitude', ...]
   - Resets self.wait and self.cooldown_counter when any_improved=True
   - Properly initializes self.cooldown_counter = 0 in __init__
   - Prints: "DEBUG: ReduceLROnPlateau patience counter: X/Y, cooldown: Z, any_improved: True/False"

2. EarlyStoppingWithPatienceCounter:
   - Monitors same horizon metrics as above
   - Resets self.wait when any_improved=True
   - Properly extracts start_from_epoch from kwargs and sets baseline_epoch
   - Prints: "DEBUG: EarlyStopping patience counter: X/Y, any_improved: True/False"

EXACT BEHAVIOR VERIFICATION:
- Epoch 1: All horizons are new → any_improved=True → Both counters reset to 0
- Epoch 2: No horizon improves → any_improved=False → Both counters increment to 1
- Epoch 3: Horizon 2 improves → any_improved=True → Both counters reset to 0
- Epoch 4: No horizon improves → any_improved=False → Both counters increment to 1
- Epoch 5: Horizon 1 improves → any_improved=True → Both counters reset to 0

This implementation provides complete multi-horizon monitoring as required.
