"""Positional encoding utility shared across predictor plugins.

Implements a deterministic sinusoidal positional encoding identical in shape to
the model inputs (window, channels) and broadcastable over the batch axis.
Returned tensor shape: (1, window, channels) so it can be added to an input
tensor of shape (batch, window, channels).
