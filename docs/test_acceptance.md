### Test Data Sets
1. **Standard Dataset**: 10,000 rows, 5 features, clean time series data
2. **Large Dataset**: 1,000,000 rows, 20 features, realistic financial data
3. **Small Dataset**: 100 rows, 3 features, minimal viable dataset
4. **Edge Case Dataset**: Missing values, outliers, irregular timestamps
5. **Corrupted Dataset**: Invalid formats, malformed data, encoding issues

## Acceptance Test Scenarios

## Test Execution Strategy

### Automated Execution

- Continuous integration pipeline executes full test suite
- Test results integrated with monitoring and alerting

### Manual Validation
- User experience tests require manual validation
- Performance tests under extreme conditions
- Configuration complexity scenarios

### Test Data Management
- Test datasets maintained in version control
- Synthetic data generation for edge cases
- Real data samples for realistic testing

## Success Criteria
All acceptance tests must pass with a 100% success rate before the refactored preprocessor plugin is considered ready for production deployment. Any test failure requires investigation, fix, and full test suite re-execution.
