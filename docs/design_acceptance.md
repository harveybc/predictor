# Data Preprocessor Plugin - Acceptance Level Design

## Overview
This document defines the acceptance-level design for the Data Preprocessor Plugin refactoring in the predictor system. The design follows a top-down BDD approach, focusing on business requirements and user acceptance criteria.

## Business Context
The Data Preprocessor Plugin is a critical component that transforms raw time series data into multiple standardized datasets suitable for machine learning prediction models. It serves as the bridge between raw financial data and the prediction pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Six-Dataset Split Support
**Given** raw time series data  
**When** the preprocessor processes the data  
**Then** it must produce exactly six datasets (d1 through d6) according to configurable split ratios  
**And** each dataset must maintain temporal ordering  
**And** datasets must be non-overlapping in time  

### AC2: Dual Z-Score Normalization
**Given** processed datasets  
**When** normalization is applied  
**Then** it must compute per-feature mean and standard deviation  
**And** store normalization parameters in two separate JSON files (means.json, stds.json)  
**And** apply z-score normalization using: (value - mean) / std  
**And** support denormalization using stored parameters  

### AC3: External Plugin Integration
**Given** a preprocessor plugin configuration  
**When** external feature engineering plugins are specified  
**Then** the system must load and execute them in the correct order  
**And** support plugin chaining with output-to-input mapping  
**And** handle plugin failures gracefully with meaningful error messages  

### AC4: External Postprocessing Support
**Given** preprocessed data  
**When** postprocessing plugins are configured  
**Then** the system must apply them after core preprocessing  
**And** maintain data integrity throughout the postprocessing chain  
**And** support conditional postprocessing based on data characteristics  

### AC5: Modern Configuration Architecture
**Given** a system configuration  
**When** the preprocessor is initialized  
**Then** it must support hierarchical configuration loading  
**And** allow parameter overrides at multiple levels (global, plugin, runtime)  
**And** validate all configuration parameters before processing  
**And** provide clear error messages for invalid configurations  

### AC6: Backward Compatibility
**Given** existing predictor system configurations  
**When** the refactored preprocessor is deployed  
**Then** it must maintain compatibility with existing data formats  
**And** support migration of old configuration files  
**And** preserve existing API contracts for dependent components  

## Success Metrics
- All existing predictor workflows continue to function without modification
- Processing time is maintained or improved compared to current implementation
- Memory usage is optimized for large datasets
- Configuration validation prevents 95% of runtime errors
- Plugin loading mechanism supports hot-swapping for development

## Quality Attributes

### Performance
- Handle datasets up to 1GB in size
- Process 100,000 time series points within 30 seconds
- Memory usage linear with dataset size (no memory leaks)

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime for preprocessing operations
- Graceful degradation when optional plugins fail
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

### Maintainability
- Plugin architecture allows independent development and testing
- Clear separation of concerns between core and plugin functionality
- Comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities

### Usability
- Configuration validation with helpful error messages
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features
- Consistent API patterns across all plugins

## Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive test coverage at all levels (acceptance, system, integration, unit)
- Staged rollout with feature flags for gradual adoption
- Rollback capability to previous preprocessor version
- Performance benchmarking to prevent regressions

## Dependencies
- Core data handling infrastructure (app.data_handler)
- Configuration management system (app.config_handler)
- Plugin loading framework (app.plugin_loader)
- Logging and monitoring systems

## Acceptance Test Strategy
Acceptance tests will be implemented as end-to-end scenarios that validate complete workflows from raw data input to processed output. Each acceptance criterion will have corresponding automated tests that can be executed independently and as part of the full test suite.

Tests will use realistic data volumes and configurations to ensure the system performs adequately under production conditions. Mock external systems will be used where necessary to ensure test reliability and speed.
