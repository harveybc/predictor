# Data Preprocessor Plugin - System Level Design

## Overview
This document defines the system-level design for the Data Preprocessor Plugin, detailing the high-level architecture, component interactions, and system-wide behaviors that fulfill the acceptance criteria.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Preprocessor Engine
**Responsibility**: Orchestrates the entire preprocessing workflow
**Key Behaviors**:
- Validates input data and configuration
- Manages dataset splitting into d1-d6
- Coordinates plugin execution pipeline
- Handles error propagation and recovery

#### 2. Dataset Splitter
**Responsibility**: Partitions time series data into six temporal datasets
**Key Behaviors**:
- Applies configurable split ratios while maintaining temporal order
- Ensures non-overlapping time windows
- Validates split integrity
- Supports both fixed and percentage-based splitting

#### 3. Normalization Manager
**Responsibility**: Manages dual z-score normalization across all datasets
**Key Behaviors**:
- Computes per-feature statistics (mean, std) across training datasets
- Stores normalization parameters in separate JSON files
- Applies consistent normalization across all datasets
- Provides denormalization capabilities

#### 4. Plugin Orchestrator
**Responsibility**: Manages external plugin lifecycle and execution
**Key Behaviors**:
- Discovers and loads feature engineering plugins
- Executes plugins in configured order
- Manages data flow between plugins
- Handles plugin failures and fallback strategies

#### 5. Configuration Validator
**Responsibility**: Ensures all configuration parameters are valid
**Key Behaviors**:
- Validates configuration schema compliance
- Checks parameter ranges and dependencies
- Provides detailed error reporting
- Supports configuration migration

### System Interfaces

#### Input Interfaces
- **Raw Data Interface**: Accepts CSV files with time series data
- **Configuration Interface**: Loads JSON/YAML configuration files
- **Plugin Interface**: Dynamically loads external processing plugins

#### Output Interfaces
- **Dataset Interface**: Produces six standardized CSV datasets (d1-d6)
- **Metadata Interface**: Outputs normalization parameters and processing logs
- **Status Interface**: Provides processing status and error information

## System Behaviors

### SB1: Robust Data Processing Pipeline
**Trigger**: Valid input data and configuration provided
**Behavior**: System processes data through entire pipeline without interruption
**Outcome**: All six datasets generated with consistent structure and quality

### SB2: Graceful Error Handling
**Trigger**: Invalid data, configuration, or plugin errors encountered
**Behavior**: System isolates errors, logs detailed information, and continues where possible
**Outcome**: Partial results with clear error reporting, system remains stable

### SB3: Plugin Integration Management
**Trigger**: External plugins specified in configuration
**Behavior**: System loads, validates, and executes plugins in correct sequence
**Outcome**: Enhanced data processing with plugin contributions integrated seamlessly

### SB4: Configuration-Driven Operation
**Trigger**: Configuration parameters updated
**Behavior**: System adapts processing behavior without code changes
**Outcome**: Flexible operation supporting diverse use cases and datasets

### SB5: Performance Optimization
**Trigger**: Large datasets or resource constraints
**Behavior**: System optimizes memory usage and processing efficiency
**Outcome**: Consistent performance across varying data sizes and system loads

## Quality Attributes Implementation

### Performance
- **Streaming Processing**: Large datasets processed in chunks to minimize memory usage
- **Parallel Plugin Execution**: Independent plugins executed concurrently when possible
- **Lazy Loading**: Data loaded only when needed, not preloaded entirely

### Reliability
- **Checkpoint System**: Intermediate results saved for recovery from failures
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive checks at each processing stage
- **Plugin Sandboxing**: Plugin failures isolated from core system

### Scalability
- **Modular Architecture**: Components can be distributed across multiple processes
- **Resource Management**: Dynamic allocation based on available system resources
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Support for processing multiple datasets concurrently

### Maintainability
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between all components
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed audit trail of all processing steps
- **Plugin Standards**: Consistent plugin API and development guidelines

## System Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.8+ runtime environment
- Memory usage proportional to dataset size (no exponential growth)
- CPU utilization optimized for available cores

### Business Constraints
- Backward compatibility with existing predictor system
- Configuration migration support for existing deployments
- API stability for dependent systems

### Operational Constraints
- Maximum processing time: 5 minutes for 1GB datasets
- Disk space: 3x input dataset size for intermediate files
- Network: Optional for plugin downloads, not required for core operation

## Integration Points

### Upstream Systems
- **Data Sources**: File systems, databases, streaming data feeds
- **Configuration Management**: External configuration repositories
- **Plugin Repositories**: Local and remote plugin storage

### Downstream Systems
- **Prediction Models**: Machine learning models consuming processed datasets
- **Monitoring Systems**: Performance and health monitoring tools
- **Storage Systems**: Persistent storage for results and metadata

## Security Considerations
- **Plugin Validation**: Digital signatures and checksums for external plugins
- **Data Privacy**: Secure handling of sensitive time series data
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to configuration and processing functions

## Deployment Architecture
- **Container Support**: Docker containerization for consistent deployment
- **Configuration Externalization**: Environment-specific configurations
- **Health Checks**: Endpoint for monitoring system health and readiness

This system design provides the foundation for implementing a robust, scalable, and maintainable data preprocessing solution that meets all acceptance criteria while supporting future extensibility and performance requirements.
