# CRITICAL ISSUES AND TODO TASKS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The preprocessor and pipeline have **FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL FLAWS** that cause terrible performance. These issues must be fixed systematically.

---

## üö® CRITICAL ERRORS IDENTIFIED

### 1. **BASELINE TEMPORAL MISALIGNMENT** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Baselines extracted from sliding windows don't correspond to correct time indices for target calculation.

**Location**: `stl_preprocessor_zscore.py` lines 234-243
**Impact**: Targets calculated with wrong baseline times ‚Üí completely invalid training data
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED

**Current Code Issue**:
```python
# WRONG: Using sliding window dates as baseline dates
baseline_dates = sliding_windows[dates_key]
baselines[f'baseline_{split}_dates'] = baseline_dates
```

**Required Fix**: Map sliding window indices back to original time series indices correctly.

### 2. **DATA CARDINALITY MISMATCH** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Target calculation produces different numbers of samples per horizon, breaking model training.

**Location**: `target_calculation.py` lines 89-120
**Impact**: Model receives mismatched X/Y data shapes ‚Üí training fails
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT FIXED

**Current Issue**: max_samples calculation truncates data differently for each horizon.

### 3. **DOUBLE SLIDING WINDOW CONFUSION** (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: The "two sliding windows" architecture is implemented incorrectly.

**Location**: `stl_preprocessor_zscore.py` lines 72-81
**Impact**: Model receives anti-naive-lock transformed sliding windows but targets calculated from different sliding windows
**Status**: ‚ùå PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Architectural Error**: Targets and features come from different data processing paths.

### 4. **ANTI-NAIVE-LOCK FEATURE MISMATCH** (HIGH)
**Problem**: Feature categorization logic is flawed, causing wrong transformations.

**Location**: `stl_preprocessor_zscore.py` lines 286-315
**Impact**: Features transformed incorrectly ‚Üí poor model performance
**Status**: ‚ùå NEEDS DEBUGGING

### 5. **NORMALIZATION PARAMETER LOSS** (HIGH)
**Problem**: Individual horizon normalization parameters not properly preserved and used.

**Location**: Multiple files
**Impact**: Predictions can't be denormalized correctly ‚Üí wrong real-world values
**Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED

### 6. **BASELINE PRESERVATION FAILURE** (MEDIUM)
**Problem**: Baselines are lost during final output preparation.

**Location**: `stl_preprocessor_zscore.py` lines 430-445
**Impact**: Prediction reconstruction impossible
**Status**: ‚ùå ATTEMPTED BUT BROKEN

## üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Step 1: Stop Current Development
- **DO NOT** continue with current implementation
- **DO NOT** test until critical issues are fixed
- **DO NOT** add new features until architecture is correct

### Step 2: Fix Critical Issues (TODO-001 to TODO-003)
1. Start with TODO-001: Fix baseline temporal alignment
2. Then TODO-002: Fix data cardinality consistency  
3. Finally TODO-003: Implement correct two-window architecture

### Step 3: Validate and Test
- Test each fix with small dataset
- Validate data flow manually
- Ensure X/Y shapes match
- Check temporal alignment

### Step 4: Only Then Proceed
- Continue with remaining TODO items
- Add optimizations and features
- Perform full system testing

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### For TODO-001 (Baseline Alignment):
- Baselines correspond to correct time indices
- Baseline dates match sliding window extraction times
- Manual verification shows correct temporal mapping

### For TODO-002 (Data Cardinality):
- ALL horizons produce exactly the same number of samples
- X_train.shape[0] == y_train[horizon_1].shape[0] == y_train[horizon_N].shape[0]
- No data truncation differences between horizons

### For TODO-003 (Two-Window Architecture):
- First sliding windows used ONLY for targets
- Second sliding windows used ONLY for model input
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent data flow documentation
